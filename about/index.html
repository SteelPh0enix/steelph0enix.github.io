Before that, i&rsquo;ve graduated <a href=https://www.zsel.lublin.eu/>Electronic School Group in Lublin</a> as an ICT technician. Also managed to take part in some IT/ICT-related contests/olympics and got a decent place in finals once.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent considerate amount of time during my education on programming. Mostly jumping between technologies and learning random things, trying to write some working code, not having a clue about Dunning-Kruger effect for too long. I&rsquo;ve also learned some electronics in high school, which lead me to participate in a funny, little embedded-programming-related project, where i&rsquo;ve meet a funny, cool doctor (master, back then) that guided me through electrical and practical engineering during my Engineer/Master degree. Thanks, Marcin!</p><p>In terms of commercial experience, I&rsquo;ve worked for two years at <a href=https://www.st.com/>STMicroelectronics</a> as part-time Trainee/Technical Support Engineer. Before that (and in the meantime), i&rsquo;ve been doing commissions as Embedded Systems Developer for small, telemedicine-related projects, writing code for STM32 MCUs used for medical data acquisition and it&rsquo;s transmission over wireless interfaces (WiFi, SubGHz, BLE). Right now i&rsquo;m employed at <a href=https://n7space.com/>N7 Space</a> as Embedded Programmer. As of writing this, i&rsquo;ve spent half year writing Crit-B compliant C code for ARM Cortex-M7 MCU, and since that i&rsquo;ve been developing <a href=https://github.com/n7space/aerugo>Aerugo RTOS</a> in Rust.</p><p>At free time i&rsquo;m usually messing with random code, writing guides or shitposting.</p><p>My language and tech stack(?):</p><ul><li>C/C++ - primary programming languages, maybe not the favorite (i like C more), but - unfortunately - necessary in this cruel world.</li><li>Python - at some point i&rsquo;ve realized i use Python more than C or C++ for stuff i don&rsquo;t need C or C++ for. That&rsquo;s basically my &ldquo;language of choice&rdquo;. For <em>most</em> things, at least.</li><li>Rust - i was trying to get hang of this language for years, but i&rsquo;ve started to feel relatively comfortable using it only recently. I really want to like this language, and it gives me lots of reasons to do so, but it has it&rsquo;s issues that annoy the shit out of me.</li><li>HTMX - honorary mention, god bless brave Montanan developers, working in JavaScript mines every day so we can consume the hypermedia. I want to use it as soon as i find motivation for a frontend project.</li><li>STM32 - MCU of choice, both because it&rsquo;s decent and has relatively good support, but also because i have shitloads of them.</li><li>SAMV71 (and also SAMRH71, <strong>which is a different product</strong>) - work-related stuff, apparently they love that shit in space. Sometimes i hate the docs for them.</li><li>ESP32 - poked with a stick few times, maybe will do something in the future</li><li>AVR - relict of the past</li><li>Arduino - only if i have to (i.e. i have literally 0 time to make this demo)</li><li>RaspberryPi - I have most OG boards (2B, 3B, 3B+, 4B, Zero W) and i have no idea what to do with them. Currently using 4B as PiHole server and probably some funny stuff in nearby future. RP2040 looks like a dope chip, i have both &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and wifi versions, but no motivation to poke them with a stick.</li><li>Windows - proud user, although it pisses me off when i need to do something in C/C++. Maybe i&rsquo;ll return to Linux full-time at some point. Maybe.</li><li>Linux - very familiar, very like&rsquo;y, daily-driven for years but now i&rsquo;m back at dualboot/VM setup. I wish WSL worked without HyperV, so i can use it along VBox with it&rsquo;s virtualization engine.</li><li>Meson - because fuck CMake.</li><li>Neovim/VSCode - when i&rsquo;m pissed at VSCode being bloat&rsquo;y, i jump to Neovim, just to remind myself why i&rsquo;m still daily driving VSCode.</li></ul><p>This list is incomplete. You can help by either annoying me with some tech, to a point where i feel like i need to warn everyone about it&rsquo;s dangers, or <a href=https://htmx.org/>shitposting hard enough so it becomes a reality</a>.</p><h3 id=contact>Contact<a href=#contact class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Github</strong> - most of my code is there: <a href=https://github.com/SteelPh0enix>https://github.com/SteelPh0enix</a></li><li><strong>Gitlab</strong> - some of my code is there, but not much: <a href=https://gitlab.com/SteelPh0enix>https://gitlab.com/SteelPh0enix</a></li><li><strong>Facebook</strong> - yeah i use one: <a href=https://www.facebook.com/steelph0en1x>https://www.facebook.com/steelph0en1x</a></li><li><strong>Twitter</strong> - <a href=https://twitter.com/steel_ph0enix>https://twitter.com/steel_ph0enix</a></li><li><strong>Discord</strong> - steelph0enix (ID: 283282938471383041)</li></ul><p>This blog is hosted via Github Pages, and the repository can be found here: <a href=https://github.com/SteelPh0enix/steelph0enix.github.io>https://github.com/SteelPh0enix/steelph0enix.github.io</a> - feel free to leave issues and pull requests.</p></div></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//steelph0enixblog.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>SteelPh0enix's Blog © 2021 by SteelPh0enix is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0</span>
