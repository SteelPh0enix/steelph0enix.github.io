## Hey, I'm SteelPh0enix AKA Wojciech Olech

I live in Poland.

I've graduated [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/) and i have an Engineer and Master degree in IT (your usual generic degree here). Before that, i've graduated [Electronic School Group in Lublin](https://www.zsel.lublin.eu/) as an ICT technician. Also managed to take part in some IT/ICT-related contests/olympics and got a decent place in finals once.

I've spent considerate amount of time during my education on programming. Mostly jumping between technologies and learning random things, trying to write some working code, not having a clue about Dunning-Kruger effect for too long. I've also learned some electronics in high school, which lead me to participate in a funny, little embedded-programming-related project, where i've meet a funny, cool doctor (master, back then) that guided me through electrical and practical engineering during my Engineer/Master degree. Thanks, Marcin!

In terms of commercial experience, I've worked for two years at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/) as part-time Trainee/Technical Support Engineer. Before that (and in the meantime), i've been doing commissions as Embedded Systems Developer for small, telemedicine-related projects, writing code for STM32 MCUs used for medical data acquisition and it's transmission over wireless interfaces (WiFi, SubGHz, BLE). Right now i'm employed at [N7 Space](https://n7space.com/) as Embedded Programmer. As of writing this, i've spent half year writing Crit-B compliant C code for ARM Cortex-M7 MCU, and since that i've been developing [Aerugo RTOS](https://github.com/n7space/aerugo) in Rust.

At free time i'm usually messing with random code, writing guides or shitposting.

My language and tech stack(?):

* C/C++ - primary programming languages, maybe not the favorite (i like C more), but - unfortunately - necessary in this cruel world.
* Python - at some point i've realized i use Python more than C or C++ for stuff i don't need C or C++ for. That's basically my "language of choice". For *most* things, at least.
* Rust - i was trying to get hang of this language for years, but i've started to feel relatively comfortable using it only recently. I really want to like this language, and it gives me lots of reasons to do so, but it has it's issues that annoy the shit out of me.
* HTMX - honorary mention, god bless brave Montanan developers, working in JavaScript mines every day so we can consume the hypermedia. I want to use it as soon as i find motivation for a frontend project.
* STM32 - MCU of choice, both because it's decent and has relatively good support, but also because i have shitloads of them.
* SAMV71 (and also SAMRH71, **which is a different product**) - work-related stuff, apparently they love that shit in space. Sometimes i hate the docs for them.
* ESP32 - poked with a stick few times, maybe will do something in the future
* AVR - relict of the past
* Arduino - only if i have to (i.e. i have literally 0 time to make this demo)
* RaspberryPi - I have most OG boards (2B, 3B, 3B+, 4B, Zero W) and i have no idea what to do with them. Currently using 4B as PiHole server and probably some funny stuff in nearby future. RP2040 looks like a dope chip, i have both "normal" and wifi versions, but no motivation to poke them with a stick.
* Windows - proud user, although it pisses me off when i need to do something in C/C++. Maybe i'll return to Linux full-time at some point. Maybe.
* Linux - very familiar, very like'y, daily-driven for years but now i'm back at dualboot/VM setup. I wish WSL worked without HyperV, so i can use it along VBox with it's virtualization engine.
* Meson - because fuck CMake.
* Neovim/VSCode - when i'm pissed at VSCode being bloat'y, i jump to Neovim, just to remind myself why i'm still daily driving VSCode.

This list is incomplete. You can help by either annoying me with some tech, to a point where i feel like i need to warn everyone about it's dangers, or [shitposting hard enough so it becomes a reality](https://htmx.org/).
