## Hey, I'm SteelPh0enix AKA Wojciech Olech

I live in Poland. I've graduated [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/) and i have Engineer's and Masters degree in IT.

In terms of commercial experience, I've worked for two years at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/) as part-time Trainee/Technical Support Engineer. In the meantime, i've been doing commissions as Embedded Systems Developer for small, telemedicine-related projects, writing code for STM32 MCUs used for medical data acquisition and it's transmission over wireless interfaces (WiFi and SubGHz). Right now i'm employed at [N7 Space](https://n7space.com/) as Embedded Systems Developer, writing Crit B, MISRA-compliant code for SAMV71 MCUs in C and C++, occasionally using Python in build tools and integration tests. In near future i'll be working on evaluation of Rust programming language for space applications.

At free time i'm usually messing with random code, writing guides or shitposting.

Main technologies i'm working in, or messing with, are:

* C/C++ - my main programming languages
* Python - a little bit, if i need something done real quick
* Qt - for GUI and a bit more advanced apps
* Rust - started learning it recently both for my own projects, and work.
* Embedded - STM32, mostly, as it's pretty great and well supported platform. Also using SAMV71 in work.
* Windows and Linux - installing, setting them up, and such things.

There are some other minor langs and tech i know, but the list would get really long if i'd wanted to write them down.

TL;DR i'm mostly low-level guy that likes to work on a hardware, occasionally stepping into high-level territory to prevent getting mad from low-level shenanigans.
